Abstract: In the first of the talk I will discuss the phenomenology of cosmic-ray diffusion in the Galaxy and the associated gamma-ray and neutrino emission. The aim is to understand how the combined study of local cosmic-ray spectra and diffuse emissions can help to unveil anomalies that may point towards either non-standard propagation scenarios (and new astrophysical phenomena in general), or new physics (for instance, particle dark matter annihilation/decay). I will then move to the cosmological settings, and explore - mainly in the context of CMB studies - how dark matter can leave an observable imprint focusing in particular on the WIMP and primordial black hole case study, and again discussing the interplay with astrophysical issues.

Speaker Bio: Daniele Gaggero obtained his PhD in Pisa under the supervision of Dario Grasso. He then obtained post-doctoral positions at SISSA (Trieste), GRAPPA (Amsterdam) and IFT (Madrid), funded by a La Caixa Junior Leader Fellowship. He started a CIDEGENT and then a Ramon y Cajal Fellowship at IFIC (Valencia), and then settled in Pisa with an INFN permanent researcher position. His research deals with theoretical astroparticle physics and cosmology, with particular focus on high-energy astrophysics (cosmic rays/gamma rays), dark matter searches, black hole phenomenology and associated gravitational signals.
