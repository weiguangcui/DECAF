Abstract: Axion Like Particles (ALP) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem in a wide range of masses. Their interaction with photons provides a rich phenomenology and enables us to search for them with many different instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this talk I will first review the birefringence effect produced by ALP DM and the search for this effect with radio and microwave telescopes. And second, their decay, that could leave an imprint on em spectra and in particular the hunt for this line in the infrared and X-ray bands.

Speaker Bio: Dr Jorge Terol Calvo works at the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) in Torino, Italy. His research lies at the intersection between particle physics and astrophysics, with special focus on unraveling the nature of DM and the origin of neutrino masses. He did his PhD on these topics at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), with research visits at Fermilab (USA), LAPTh (France) and KIT (Germany). After that he moved to his current postdoctoral position in Torino.
