Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the end products of the hierarchical formation of structures in the universe in the ΛCDM paradigm. Despite their great masses, clusters are relatively young systems -- some of which are virialized, while others remain dynamically disturbed. Their late formation and large masses make clusters excellent probes of cosmology. Additionally, a wide variety of astrophysical processes in clusters shape their thermodynamic states and influence the evolution of galaxies. In this talk, I will first outline how clusters serve as a unique laboratory for exploring these processes. I will then present my recent work on a ubiquitous phenomenon called sloshing cold front in the nearby Virgo cluster. This cold front lies at roughly 250 kpc from the cluster center and likely belongs to a much larger spiral structure. I will conclude by discussing how hydrodynamic cosmological simulations help reveal the underlying physics driving observational properties of clusters.

Speaker Bio: Dr Sheng-Chieh Lin is graduated from the university of Kentucky, working on various topics of galaxy clusters. His work mainly focuses on analyzing optical and X-ray data of clusters with a particular interest in developing novel machine learning tools.
