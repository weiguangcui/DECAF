Abstract: I will update on our progress on the AGORA and Three-Hundred projects within the CROCODILE simulation framework using GADGET4-OSAKA.  I will highlight following four recent works on high-z galaxies (Kim et al.; arXiv:2511.04435), dwarf galaxies (Tomaru et al.; arXiv:2510.26513), AGN-jet evolution (Dong et al.; arXiv:2508.21282) and on FRB cosmology (Zhang et al. arXiv:2503.12741).  The last work analyzes cosmological dispersion measures (DM) along FRB sight lines and the intervening/host halos, and we make quantitative predictions of the CGM and IGM fractions, providing a concrete path toward resolving the “missing baryon” problem. Finally, I will also connect these insights to complementary efforts such as Lyα forest tomography and mock challenges for Subaru PFS, and briefly introduce the UNITY initiative aimed at unifying inference across FRBs, IGM tomography, and galaxy surveys. 

Speaker Bio: Ken Nagamine is a Full Professor in the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Osaka University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Princeton University in 2001 under the supervision of Jerry Ostriker. From 2001 to 2004, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow with Lars Hernquist at the Harvard–CfA, followed by a postdoctoral appointment with Art Wolfe and Mike Norman at the UC San Diego from 2004 to 2006. He then served as Assistant Prof. (2006–2011) and Associate Prof. (2011–2013) at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, before joining Osaka University in 2013 as Full Professor. His research spans a broad range of topics in galaxy formation and cosmology, including studies of the Lyman-alpha forest and fast radio burst (FRB) baryon surveys. In this talk, he will discuss the baryon distribution in the universe, highlighting results from the CROCODILE cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, as well as insights from the AGORA Project, the 300-Project, and future research directions.
