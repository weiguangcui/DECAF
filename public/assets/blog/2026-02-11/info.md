Abstract: In this talk, I will present a new avenue of how to test new physics with neutrinos - the observation of (solar) neutrino scattering in dark matter direct detection experiments. It will be the first time coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) will be detected from astrophysical neutrinos, as opposed to reactors or spallation sources. Simultaneously, it will provide a complementary measurement of solar neutrinos via elastic neutrino-electron scattering. I will review the implications of this novel signal both for neutrino physics within and beyond the Standard Model. Finally, I will briefly discuss the prospects of observing solar neutrino scattering with RES-NOVA, a novel cryogenic bolometer experiment designed to observe CEvNS of astrophysical neutrino sources.

Speaker Bio: Dr. Patrick Foldenauer is a theoretical particle physicist working on dark matter, neutrinos and light new particles. He obtained his PhD from Heidelberg University in 2019 and was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology (IPPP) at Durham University. His research combines collider, astroparticle, and direct-detection approaches to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. He is currently a La Caixa Junior Leader Fellow and leads a research group on neutrinos and dark sectors at the Instituto de Fisica Teorica (IFT UAM-CSIC) in Madrid.
